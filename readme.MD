Reliable Tradie is a plugin I created for a customer who dropped the ball on the project.

The idea was great: a company gives us its address, and tells what kind of tradies they are (electricians, plummers, carpenters, etc), and what areas of the country
they're operating in. 

If a user is seeking a carpenter, electrician, etc, the plugin could provide a list of "tradies" operating in that area.

It was created years ago, but I found out it still works, but needs a lot of improvement.
